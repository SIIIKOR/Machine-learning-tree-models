## Machine learning tree algorithms
Python package with decision tree algorithms purely writen in python.

Because of this, this implementation is slower than other available alternatives for example scikit learn decision tree.

This project was created mainly for learning purpose.

## Implemented algorithms
### Classification tree
### Regression tree
### tree pruning (although it works badly)
### Random forest (implemented algorithm for working with nan values and visualisation of similar samples)

## Usage

You have to import decision tree model that you want to use to your script.
